# Provenance
This project is used to help analyze a set of thin sections for provenance. The first code uses the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine if one outcrop comes from the same distribution as the rest of the outcrops. The second  part of the project uses principle components analysis on the minerals to determine which minerals  contribute most to the provenance.
